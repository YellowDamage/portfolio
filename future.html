<p>In the future, I plan to pursue an education, and to study either Computer Science, or Software Engineering. If possible, I'd like to stay in town and study at either OttawaU or Carleton University, and I haven't seen any alternatives that I'd prefer. I'm planning on taking Co-Op while in University, preferably working for the Government of Canada, to hopefully gain some experience under my belt so that it's easier for me to find a job once I complete school. In my personal life, I'm going to continue coding as a hobby, coding small applications and websites, and modifications to games I play, such as Minecraft. Overall, I'm really thankful that I had the opportuntiy to take Mr. Osudar's course, as it really openned my eyes to the overwhelming opportunities there are within the coding/computer science field, and that I shouldn't limit myself.</p>
