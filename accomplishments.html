<h2>Algorithms course on Khan Academy</h2>
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
<p>From the Algorithms module on Khan Academy, I learned a lot. It helped me deepen my understanding and appreciation for algorithms, and understand how insanely useful they can be. I also learned that they're implemented a lot more than I thought, and can be seen everywhere in day to day life. I really enjoyed this module, and it's content which is why it made my top 10 list.</p>

<h2>Intro to JS course on Khan Academy</h2>
<br>
<br>
<div class="centerimage">

<br>
<br>
<p>The Intro to JS course on khan academy was great. It helped me develop a basic understanding of JS, and was my first ever experience with it. I developped basic JS skills with this course, and started to code my first programs/projects thanks to this course. It also inspired me for future personal projects that I would do in the future, and also future projects in the course. It made my top 10 list because it was a very memorable course that was packed full of essential and useful information.</p>

<h2>Intro to HTMl/CSS course on Khan Academy</h2>
<br>
<br>
<div class="centerimage">
    <img src="images/htmlcss.PNG"alt="" class="jsimage">
</div>
<br>
<br>
<p>Another course I took on Khan Academy was Intro to HTML/CSS. This course was outstanding at teaching basic key HTML and CSS elements, and web development. It lead the way for a lot of creative insight into future projects, and gave me my first look into coding/creating websites. It was a course that's forever etched into my mind, as I thought it was super cool to be able to code the foundations of something I use daily; websites.</p>

<h2>Advanced JS : Natural Simulations course on Khan Academy</h2>
<br>
<br>
<div class="centerimage">

</div>
<br>
<br>
<p>The Advanced JS : Natural Simulations course on Khan Academy was another course that I took and thoroughly enjoyed. It tought me some more advanced aspects of JS, more specifically simulating nature with code. I thought it was super cool to be able to use mathematics and code to simulate natural movement, with things like the Levy Walkers. </p>

<h2>Advanced JS : Games and Visualizations course on Khan Academy</h2>
<br>
<br>
<div class="centerimage">
    <img src="images/gamevisual.PNG"alt="" class="jsimage">
</div>
<br>
<br>
<p>Advanced JS : Games and Visualizations was another course on Khan Academy that I took. It essentially took my basic understanding of JS, and tought me new techniques and ways to apply code to make things like multi-scene programs, using buttons, 3D graphics, scored games, and scene programs among other things. Gaming is a passion of mine, and being able to code games, even if they're small ones was still super cool to me.</p>

<h2>Intro to SQL</h2>
<br>
<br>
<div class="centerimage">
    <img src="images/SQL.PNG"alt="" class="jsimage">
</div>
<br>
<br>
<p>Intro to SQL was another Khan Academy course taken by me. Intro to SQL is a course that teaches you the basics and essentials of using SQL to communicate with databases. It teaches you how to query, manipulate, and store data, and then how to call on it again. Before taking this course it didn't even cross my mind that there was an entirely different language for this, and this course really openned my eyes to the endless possibilites of coding. </p>

<h2>Basic CSS course on Free Code Camp</h2>
<br>
<br>
<div class="centerimage">
    <img src="images/genji.PNG"alt="" class="jsimage">
</div>
<br>
<br>
<p>Basic CSS was a course on Free Code Camp that I've taken. It took my basic understanding of HTML/CSS that I learned from Khan Academy, and took it up a notch. It required me to implement HTML/CSS in ways that I never have before, and made me realise the opportunities for creativity when it comes to making webpages. Styling websites with CSS was super cool to me, I loved being able to see the differences being made with each line of code that I changed.</p>

<h2>Applied Visual Design course on Free Code Camp</h2>
<br>
<br>
<div class="centerimage">
    <img src="images/survey.PNG"alt="" class="jsimage">
</div>
<br>
<br>
<p>Another Free code camp course that I took was Applied Visual Design. It was another addition to my basic understanding of HTMl/CSS, and sort of brought everything together. It combined typography, color theory, graphics, animation, and page layout. All of these in combination further made me realise how the visual effect of a website is really the "wow" factor, and it actually matters a lot more than people think.</p>

<h2>Rubiks cube timer</h2>
<br>
<br>
<div class="centerimage">
    <img src="images/rct.PNG"alt="" class="jsimage">
</div>
<br>
<br>
<p>The Rubiks Cube timer that I made alongside Arjun, Ryan D., and Van was one of my first experiences with JS outside of Khan Academy/Free code camp. It forced me to bring all of my skills together, utilizing HTMl/CSS to make the website itself, and then JS to code the actual timer/scramble. I felt a huge sense of satisfaction when getting the scramble to work, and it was amazing to be like, "this is something that I made, and it works". It also made me realise how essential Github is for version control, and how there's always a way to improve your code. </p>

<h2>Pixel sorting creative refactoring</h2>
<br>
<br>
<div class="centerimage">
    <img src="images/pixelsort.PNG"alt="" class="jsimage">
</div>
<br>
<br>
<p>Creatively refactoring the pixel sorting algorithm made by Dan Shiffman was one of my later experiences with coding in Mr. Osudar's class. It was my first time ever working with Processing, and Java, and it made me realise that even though the languages are sort of similar, they're also completely different. Working on the project made me tap into my creativity, and think of ways to alter the code to show something cool. I feel like I pulled it off, and it's a great start. Working on the project made me realise that a lot of code that I write is inefficient, and can be vastly improved. It's made me realise that there are some next steps for me to take when I continue my career as a coder, and that starting now I need to implement those changes into all of my work.</p>
