    <p class="used">In Mr. Osudar's ICS4U class, I learned how to use and implement many different types of technology, software, and programming languages. More specfically, I began using github, and realised that it's an insanely useful tool for managing projects, and tracking progress of projects, and managing tasks when working in groups.
    Some of the actual coding languages/softwares that I began using in his class were processing, JS, p5.js, and Visual studio code. Learning Javascript, and starting to implement it with HTML and CSS was really cool to me, and definitly a standout of the course. It also gave me a deeper understanding for computer science concepts, and mathematical concepts such as vectors, and maxels,and things like natural simulations with code.
   Learning parts of processing/java made me realise that I shouldn't limit myself to only a handful of languages, as trying out new ones can prove extremely useful, and have some cool features. In processing for example, due to some built in functions it
   's a lot easier to pixel sort. While participating in the class, I saw people using visual studio code, and thought to myself that it looked really clean, and helped keep everything organized. Currently, i'm writing this in visual studio code! I found the extensions, such as the live server to be extremely useful, and it has a ton of cool features that other code editing softwares simply don't provide. I'm 100% going to continue to use it in the future.
