<p>Hi there reader! I'm a student at A.Y Jackson Secondary School that has lived his whole life in Ottawa Ontario. Currently, I work at ChartWell Stillwater Creek, a retirement home, as a dietary aide (server) part time. I'm a student that's interested in computer science, and software developement, and hope to one day get a job developping software or games. In the nearer future, I'm planning on maintaining a 90 average in my grade 11 school year, and hopefully study either Computer Science, or Software Engineering at either OttawaU, or Carleton University.</p>
